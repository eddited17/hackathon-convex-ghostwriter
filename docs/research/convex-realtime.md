Key takeaways:
- Convex provides a realtime reactive database where all query dependencies are tracked automatically; any data changes trigger query re-execution and updates to subscribed clients.
- Reactive architecture eliminates manual cache management and polling; query results are cached and revalidated automatically.
- Designed for reactive UI frameworks (e.g., React), with automatic UI updates from Convex client libraries; also supports backend subscriptions (Python, Rust) for server-side reactions.
- Supports ubiquitous reactivity across frontend and backend, enabling background business process triggers on state change.
- Offered as part of Convex's managed platform with SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA, and GDPR compliance.
