## Interviewing & Discovery
- Professional ghostwriters start with a structured intake interview covering eleven core areas: project concept, motivation/outcomes, existing research, target audience, timeline, publishing path, budget, prior ghostwriting experience, availability, communication preferences, and anxieties. (Association of Ghostwriters)
- Early interviews surface red flags, expectation mismatches, and client commitment level; detecting these early prevents relationship breakdowns. (Association of Ghostwriters)
- Working sessions help clients clarify their ideas and sharpen goals; the interview phase is often transformative for the client, not just fact finding. (Jane Friedman)

## Listening & Voice Capture
- Capturing voice goes beyond transcription; structure, tone, and content must be co-defined with the client. Ghostwriters often “perform” an impression of the client, aligning on sentence cadence, formality, humor, and storytelling preferences. (Cracking “Voice”)
- Voice creation can be collaborative—some clients want to sound more authoritative or refined than their natural speech. Document desired adjustments explicitly. (Cracking “Voice”)
- Maintain recordings, transcripts, and style exemplars; review them to detect patterns and canonical phrases. (Writers Write)

## Research & Material Gathering
- Ghostwriters rely on organized source material: interviews, documents, research packets. Assess the client’s preparedness and plan for gaps early. (Association of Ghostwriters, Writers Write)
- Supplement client input with independent research to contextualize stories and confirm facts; capture anecdotes, case studies, and proof points to enrich writing. (Writers Write)

## Collaborative Process & Expectations
- Outline creation typically follows preliminary interviews, iterating through high-level and expanded outlines before deep drafting. (Jane Friedman)
- Set cadence for check-ins, draft reviews, and edits (e.g., by section or word count milestone) to keep clients engaged and prevent late-stage surprises. (Writers Write)
- Clarify communication channels and response expectations; mismatched preferences (email vs. calls/meetings) can derail momentum. (Association of Ghostwriters)
- Discuss budget ranges early to ensure alignment and avoid sunk time. (Association of Ghostwriters)

## Time Commitment & Client Role
- Ghostwriting still demands client involvement—typically multiple interview days, outline reviews, and manuscript feedback. Screen for availability to avoid stalled projects. (Association of Ghostwriters, Jane Friedman)
- Emphasize the co-creator role: clients should add stories, clarify concepts, and approve drafts to maintain authenticity. (Jane Friedman)

## Editing, Feedback, and Iteration
- Build iterative feedback loops; editing “throughout” lets clients raise concerns earlier and keeps the ghostwriter aligned with evolving goals. (Writers Write)
- Encourage clients to articulate what success looks like (reader impact, professional outcomes) and revisit these checkpoints during revisions. (Association of Ghostwriters)

## Role of Trust & Professionalism
- Transparency about process, deliverables, and fees builds trust and reduces anxiety over authorship credit. (Jane Friedman)
- Track commitments and boundaries: interview schedules, revision rounds, off-limit subjects. Consistent professionalism protects reputation and outcomes. (Association of Ghostwriters, Writers Write)

## Implications for AI Ghostwriter Design
- Intake flows should echo the eleven-question framework, probing vision, timeline, target audience, publishing goals, and client availability.
- Conversation prompts must support co-creating voice: clarify desired tone, structure, humor, and authority level; capture “do” and “don’t” lists.
- The system should log and categorize anecdotes, research leads, and style cues for background drafting and future sessions.
- Real-time agent behavior should include expectation resets, milestone check-ins, and budget/timeline awareness to mirror trusted human ghostwriters.
